in this post we shall discuss things you can do with lavander.

i alway love a lavender bag wether you buy them or create on youself they allways smell amazing.
you can grow lavender the bees love it and it looks great in a pot ( it can be a little picky about the condiotns its in but it can also over take everthing so make sure its seperated from other plants)
if you grow your own lavender then you you cut off pieces and dry them in your house which makes a good decoration and also smells good.
final you could make some kind of bathroom product with lavender in such as a bathbomb.
