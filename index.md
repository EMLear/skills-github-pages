# Hi there i am looking foward to getting to know you! # 

*I am all about getting out in nature and seeing what we can do with what mother nature provides*

I live on the outskirts of Christchurch in New Zeland where there is wonderful nature and architecture. I live alone except with my best freind my dachshund buttercup.
